Pintwitterest
=============

Pintwitterest shows a Pinterest style view of a user's favorited tweets.

This is built with Node.js, Express, Jade and ntwitter.

This uses Twitter's REST API for getting the favorites and oEmbed for displaying a tweet within a page. For some reason, oEmbed's aren't working with all the tweets!
